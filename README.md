# Oauth
This application demonstrates how OAuth can be used for Grant Type = authorization_code
1) "Oauth" is the resource application.
2) "Oauth-client" is the client application.

Oauth will display the list of Employees only when it gets approval from the Oauth-client application.
For the approval to happen, a code is shared (since the grant type is authorization_code) between the Resource server and the client server.
